# Server foundations goal

Status: active. Started 2026-09-25 from `02c51ba`.

Keep Go, PostgreSQL, one deployable server, and the authoritative extractor,
runtime asset, and scripted-action contracts. Improve runtime safety through
small verified changes. No production deployment or push is part of this goal.

## Milestones and acceptance checks

1. **Request and session boundary** (initial checkpoint complete): bound incoming messages and
   connection waits, enforce session prerequisites centrally, remove the unused
   session-ID/IP takeover mechanism, and close the actual transport on session
   removal. Exercise malformed/oversized/partial messages and requests made
   before character selection through the real dispatcher and socket boundary.
2. **Atomic gameplay persistence**: move purchases, inventory consumption,
   rewards, and party updates into shared transaction-aware operations; preserve
   Pokémon identities; update caches and publish success only after commit.
   Prove rollback, concurrent updates, ownership validation, and duplicate-command
   behavior using PostgreSQL where its semantics matter.
3. **Character state ownership**: bounded serialized commands, one active owner
   per character, safe connection replacement and disconnect cleanup, explicit
   coordination with movement, battle, timers, and shared world state. Verify
   concurrent requests, stale connections, cancellation, and reconnect in battle
   with the race detector and real transport integration tests.
4. **Domain and wire boundaries**: extract cohesive gameplay domains as their
   operations move, inject dependencies, keep handlers thin, and use explicit
   JSON names as the single source for wire data and generated TypeScript.
   Document and complete the migration away from redundant casing conversions;
   preserve existing public payloads unless a coordinated change is necessary.
5. **Service lifecycle and verification**: fail startup on required initialization
   errors, report readiness, drain work and persist active players on shutdown,
   bound database/network waits, and provide concise operational diagnostics.
   Verify success, startup failure, slow clients, timeouts, cancellation, retries,
   duplicate requests, and shutdown during active gameplay. Run appropriate Go,
   frontend, generated-contract, and integration checks before completion.

## Evidence and decisions

- Baseline focused race tests passed for `internal/session`, `internal/server`,
  and `internal/pokebattle`; these do not cover concurrent live sessions.
- The checked-in browser creates fresh `/cq` or `/ws` connections without a
  `sid` query. Reconnect will require fresh authentication; remove the unused
  takeover path rather than inventing a second authentication protocol.
- The largest existing inbound structured batch is the tile editor's 500-tile
  request. Packet bounds must accommodate that existing contract and must not
  limit larger outbound map/catalog responses.
- Existing transactions in daycare, trades, tile editing, and imports provide
  reusable patterns. Extend the authoritative systems instead of duplicating them.

## Progress

- Initial boundary checkpoint: 256 KiB incoming packet limit (including a
  500-tile batch regression), outer WebSocket message limits, partial-frame and
  stream-handshake deadlines, serialized reliable writes with deadlines, one
  reliable control stream per WebTransport session, centralized session-stage
  and JSON-object validation, unique IDs across transports, and actual transport
  closure on removal. New sessions participate in idle expiry immediately.
- The reliable stream can remain idle while WebTransport heartbeat datagrams
  arrive. Only a started frame gets a frame deadline; session expiry handles idle
  connections. Applying a blanket reliable-stream idle timeout would disconnect
  healthy WebTransport players.
- Focused race checks passed across API framing, sessions, server transports,
  and world handlers. Tests include real loopback WebSocket and WebTransport
  connections, oversized messages, partial-frame timeout, extra control streams,
  session-ID takeover rejection, session closure, and character prerequisites.
- Remaining: serialized character execution and cleanup, atomic gameplay
  operations, dependency/wire migration, lifecycle/readiness, and broader real
  gameplay/PostgreSQL/browser verification. The goal is not complete.
- Economy checkpoint: purchases validate the exact merchant/map/offer, honor
  price overrides and stock, and commit payment and inventory placement together.
  Selling credits the entire removed stack and rolls back deletion on payment
  failure. Inventory mutations share bounded transactions and character locking,
  enforce ownership, preserve all grant quantities across stacks, and propagate
  failures. Inventory queries now use an explicit database/transaction Store;
  the global unsynchronized item cache is removed. World composition still has
  global database dependencies to migrate in later checkpoints.
- Department-store offers carry their source merchant ID; purchases send that ID
  and publish a fresh inventory snapshot after commit. An old client selecting
  a sibling clerk's offer may receive a rejection and must reload; the server
  does not guess another merchant or price. Inventory TypeScript is generated
  from the Go types. Tygo is pinned, and the existing shared scripted-action alias
  is explicitly mapped so regeneration no longer degrades it to `any`.
- PostgreSQL verification covers full rollback after a grant failure, competing
  purchases, stock exhaustion, foreign ownership, concurrent grants/consumption,
  stack overflow, whole-stack sale, repeated sale, nested rollback, and lock-wait
  cancellation. Dispatcher tests verify failed commits do not publish success.
  All Go packages, frontend typechecking, runtime asset validation, and the
  production frontend build passed at this checkpoint. The PostgreSQL runner
  was also exercised end to end, including cleanup of its private cluster.
- Next: atomic party persistence with stable Pokémon row IDs, then combine item
  consumption/rewards and their gameplay effects under the same transaction.
  Command deduplication, reconnect gameplay, shutdown, and rendered verification
  are still required; these inventory tests do not establish those properties.

## Reproducible PostgreSQL tests

With `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, and Go available, run:

```bash
bash scripts/testing/run-go-postgres.sh
```

The runner creates its own cluster under `/var/tmp`, listens only on its private
Unix socket, runs race-enabled Go tests, and stops only that cluster. Each test
uses an isolated schema built from the canonical runtime schema. No application
configuration or production database is read. A CI PostgreSQL service can instead
set `CAPTUREQUEST_TEST_DATABASE_URL` explicitly; tests skip without that variable.
